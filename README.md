# Reminders App

Just a simple reminders program to store and show reminders in an easy-to-use way. The entire data will be stored in an SQLite DB so it is easy to use programs like [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/) in order to sync the reminders between different devices.

I built this mainly for myself since I didn't find a good program that could satisfy this requirement and I am not going to rely on cloud calendars or cloud services for this stuff. Besides, having reminders to do something is an easier workflow for me than using a calendar-based UI for some reason.

Right now it is a Python script for prototyping purposes, but later it will be an Android app (probably using React Native) and some Linux desktop variant (perhaps using Qt + CLI support, not sure about language choice yet).
